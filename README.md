### Change Detection using VGG19 Feature Maps
This project implements a simple change detection mechanism using deep feature extraction from the VGG19 architecture. It computes the difference between feature maps of two images and highlights changes using Otsu's thresholding.

Requirements
- Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-image

Usage
Place your two images (img1.png and img2.png) in the working directory.

Run the script:
python change_detection.py

How It Works
Feature Extraction:
- The script builds a simplified VGG19 model, extracting feature maps from different convolutional blocks.
- Features from both images are extracted and compared.

Change Detection:
- The squared difference between feature maps is computed.
- Feature maps are resized to match the first feature map size.
- The final change map is obtained by averaging the difference maps and applying Otsuâ€™s threshold.

Visualization:
The detected change regions are displayed as a binary mask.

Example Output:
The script generates a binary change map highlighting differences between the two images.
